play() {
    h.blackjack

    h.join
    limit number of players?

    h.bet 100

    minimum bid?
    max bet amount? 5000? 10000?
    bids be mod 25, otherwise round (to nearest 25?) basically figure out how to get pretty numbers
    or if greater than 1000 do mod 250?

    honbar iterates through list of players in order they joined and asks for hit/stand/evaluates a blackjack deal 
    if player does not respond in 15s? skip them (stand)
    if player says h.hit/stand when honbar is on them, respond and hit, otherwise do nothing
    if hit, stay on player, if stand, continue to next player until all players have stood or busted

    on round end >

    if a player runs out of points/money after their bet is lost, give them back the minimum amount (1000)?
    increase a tally of how many times they've bankrupted?

    h.leave

    h.join available

    h.continue to do another round once one is over

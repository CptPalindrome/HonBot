# HonBot

A discord bot with stupid functions

Created by CptPalindrome

---

## To start the bot

You will need to have node.js, then run 'node bot.js' once you have changed out the auth token for your own.

Feel free to fork this repo and modify it to your heart's content.

## Current Commands:

### [These all are precluded with 'h.']

### face

- Honbar will say the best emoji face in existence.

### say

- Honbar will say whatever it is you type after "say" and delete your message for you. He's talking! You can add /tts at the beginning and have him use tts in his message. Powerful!

### dr

- Short for "don't read", this will post a link to a youtube video and frame it with a custom emoji from my server. If someone finds this and really wants it, let me know and I can hook you up. You might need to change the code for your new emoji id though.

### gandhi (#)

- Honbar spouts a *totally real* Gandhi quote.

- Optionally you can include a number after the word gandhi (i.e. h.gandhi 43) to select that quote. If it is outside the limit, either too low or too high, it will pull at random.

### git

- Posts the link to the git repo for HonBot's amazing source code & well formulated readme notes. AKA this!

### help

- Lists all of these useful commands

### help gandhi

- Displays information about h.gandhi's functional purpose. It's pretty easy to figure out after literally one use, but whatever.

### Honbar, delete this

- Put this anywhere in any message in any case with or without the comma, and after 2 seconds (roughly), Honbar will delete your message.

## Extra "Features"

- When a new text channel is created, Honbar will immediately go to that channel and comment in it, laying stake to his claim.

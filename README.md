A discord bot with stupid functions

##################################

<h2>Current Commands:</h2>

<h3>[These all are precluded with 'h.']</h3>

<b>hi</b>

  -Honbar says hello back to you

<b>face</b>

  -Honbar will say the best emoji face in existence.

<b>say</b>

  -Honbar will say whatever it is you type after "say" and delete your message for you. He's talking! You can add /tts at the beginning and have him use tts in his message. Powerful!

<b>gandhi</b>

-Honbar spouts a <i>totally real</i> Gandhi quote.

-Posts the link to the git repo for HonBot's amazing source code & well formulated readme notes. AKA this!

<b>help</b>

  -Lists all of these useful commands

<b>help gandhi</b>

-Displays information about h.gandhi's functional purpose. It's pretty easy to figure out after literally one use, but whatever.

<b>Honbar, delete this</b>

  -Put this anywhere in any message in any case with or without the comma, and after 2 seconds (roughly), Honbar will delete your message.


<h2>Extra "Features":</h2>

-When a new text channel is created, Honbar will immediately go to that channel and comment in it, laying stake to his claim.

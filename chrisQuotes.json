        "To get technical most switches in homes are single pole, single throw, where it's either an open circuit (off) or a closed circuit (on). A single pole double throw would look similar to a single throw, however the “off” position would be connected to another circuit (think if you had a backup generator and main electric coming into a house, you'd use a double throw for that so you could connect to either the main or the generator).

        "So in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, they had firework displays and you could customize the "show" by dragging and dropping fireworks into a timeline, and selecting which mortar they should come out of. It was actually pretty in depth with how much customization you could do. And there was in game music you could add to the show, and time the beats with pretty explosions, fountains, and even lazers. "But did they only let you do displays to the in game music" I hear you ask, and the answer is NO! You could add your own custom music (for some reason, mp3 wouldn't work for me, so I had to convert to WMA). All this to say, I definitely tried to make a firework display in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 to Calvin Harris's Summer."

By {verb ending in -ing1} where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is {adjective ending in -er1}), it obtains a difference, or {noun2}. The guidance subsystem uses {noun2} to generate corrective commands to drive the {noun1} from a(n) {location1} where it is to a(n) {location1} where it isn't, and arriving at a(n) {location1} where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the {location1} where it is, is now the {location1} that it wasn't, and it follows that the {location1} that it was, is now the {location1} that it isn't. In the event that the {location1} that it is in is not the {location1} that it wasn't, the system has acquired a(n) {noun3}, the {noun3} being the difference between where the {noun1} is, and where it wasn't. If {noun3} is considered to be a(n) {adjective1} {noun4}, it too may be corrected by the GEA ({word starting with G1} {word starting with E1} {word starting with A1}). However, the {noun1} must also know where it was. The {noun1} guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a {noun3} has modified some of the information the {noun1} has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by {verb einding in -ing2} this from the algebraic {noun5} of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its {noun3}, which is called error."
